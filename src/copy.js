[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome articles & resources for **[Unreal game engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)**.
Those focused on a particular art direction are separated out.  You may find a few links not specific to UE, but are about 3d assets, game or movie production, etc.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome?tab=readme-ov-file#gaming) list.
(A bit different, since the CSV bookmark dump &
[all page](https://github.com/tomByrer/awesome-unreal-engine/blob/main/all.md#unreal-engine--bookmarks) contains *many* other links that didn't make the 'awesome' list.)

Not all resources are [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome?tab=readme-ov-file#gaming).
But hopefully all of these will find their audience.
