[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome articles & resources for **[Unreal game engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)**, though most techniques will work with many art directions given enough tweaks.
There are a select few non-specific Unreal Engine/Stylized resources.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list.  (A bit different, since the CSV bookmark dump & [all page]() contains *many* other links that didn't make the 'awesome' list.)

## (UE5 tutorials & assets focus on a Stylized art direction, optimizations, Blueprints, C++, etc)

A curated long list of awesome articles & resources for **[Unreal game engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)**.

Not all resources are [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).  But hopefully all of these will find their audience.  (This is the CSV bookmark dump formatted in Markdown.)
